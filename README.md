# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions to the problems from Advent of Code 2021 in JavaScript. Link https://adventofcode.com/

## Notes
The code is for the most part not refactored or commented. The input text data for the problem can appear in different ways depending on the problem. For smaller input data it may just be copied/pasted and assigned to a variable in the script-file. But for most problems it is parsed from a text-file found in the same directory. Some problems have a separate script-file for solving Part 1 and Part 2. Other problems solve both parts in the same script.
